									<h5>Projects</h5>
             							<p id="thesis"><b>Fungal Fiction</b></p>
        	   							<p>As part of the English Honors Program, Gracie completed an undergraduate thesis paper in her penultimate semester. For this project, she extensively researched both literary and scientific fields. Her 40-page essay, titled “Fungal Fiction: The Development of Fungi in Literature from the Nineteenth to Twenty-First Centuries,” engaged with an abundance of scholarship, three primary sources, and a unique thesis. A presentation of her paper was accepted into the College of Humanities and Social Science's <time datetime:"2024">2024</time> Undergraduate Research Symposium and was presented the Innovation in Methods and Ideas Award.</p>
        	    						<p><b>Abstract</b>: Fungi are liminal, boundary-defying organisms in the spheres of science, culture, and literature. Scholars conclude that fungi, with their scientific and cultural (mis)understandings, are employed in fiction as a method of exploring the Anthropocene, posthumanism, and alternative human-nonhuman relations. However, literary fungi are not a common topic of scholarship, and even less so is a mapping of their development across time. By crafting a literary timeline from the nineteenth to twenty-first century and performing close readings of touchstone texts, as well as relating their portrayal to (ethno)mycological understandings across the centuries, I demonstrate the continuities and disparities of fungi in literature. This essay further illuminates the non-normative literary forms found in fungal fiction and the interconnections of the sciences and humanities. My analysis reveals that fungal fiction acts as a method for humans to engage with complex aspects of the environment that queer the distinction between human and nonhuman. Until the mid-twentieth century, these human-environment entanglements were expressions of fear concerned with maintaining the human as separate from or above nature. Moving toward the turn of the twenty-first century, however, there was a shift toward imagining a posthuman, multispecies identity through fungal engagements. I argue that this timeline illuminates our changing perception and interaction with the Anthropocene and that fungal fiction itself acts as its own multispecies entanglement between humans and fungi.</p>

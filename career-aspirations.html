      <h2>Cover Letter</h2>
        <section class="coverletter">
        <p>My mother says I was born with a book in my hand. Ever since I was little, my attention has been captured by books of all kinds: fiction, nonfiction, and poetry alike. In fact, I can never be separated from them—a book is tucked into my bag wherever I go. It’s my love for reading and my desire to <em>share</em> this love that has led me to want a career in publishing.</p>
        <p>In <time datetime="2025-05">May 2025</time>, I earned a bachelor’s degree in English literature with honors from George Mason University, and I am now pursuing a master’s in English literature and a graduate certificate in publishing practice. Volunteering for Poetry Daily, a non-profit poetry anthology, has solidified my desire to work in the publishing industry; thus far, I’ve had the opportunity to assist in several departments of the organization: acquisitions, editorial review, and website production. Starting in <time datetime="2025-08">August 2025</time>, I will be expanding my participation in Poetry Daily as a Graduate Professional Assistant. After the completion of this position, I hope to gain further experience with publishing and eventually make my way into the industry as a working professional.</p>
        <p>Various elements of my background would allow me to flourish in this industry. Thus far at Poetry Daily, for example, I have accrued experience with acquisitions databases, copyright, website production, and editorial review, and my knowledge will only grow as I continue to work with them. My English degree has equipped me with excellent editing and communication skills as well. At other positions as a bookseller, I became knowledgeable of the contemporary literary landscape, and I spent a lot of time doing customer service. Practically all of my roles involved basic office skills and Microsoft Office. A natural multi-tasker and highly attentive to details, I believe I would provide strong support and cultivate worthwhile experience as a publishing professional, contributing to the invaluable sharing of literature.</p>
        <p>With recent developments, I find it more and more important to support independent and non-profit publishers and the creation of books—it would be a privilege to be a part of the publishing industry. Please feel free to reach out to me with any opportunities for which you believe I'd be a great fit.</p>
